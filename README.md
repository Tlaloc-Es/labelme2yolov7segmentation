# LabelMe2Yolov7Segmentation

This repository was designed in order to label images using [LabelMe](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme) and transform to [YoloV7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) format for instance segmentation

## Instalation

`pip install labelme2yolov7segmentation`

## Usage

First of all, make your dataset with LabelMe, after that call to the following command

`labelme2yolo --source-path /labelme/dataset --output-path /another/path`

The arguments are:

* `--source-path`: That indicates the path where are the json output of LabelMe
* `--output-path`: The path where you can save the converted files

This will make two kinds of outputs:

* *.txt: where \* is the name of the original json generated by LabelMe
* labels.txt: Where you have the relation between the number and the label set in the image
